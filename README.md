# CFG: SQL & Data Challenge

After doing 8 weeks SQL & data course, I decided to enter this MOOC hackathon/challenge by Code First Girls (with Cognizant Foundation). I was in team Lime and worked together with 3 more people, who are Suzilah, Judy and Katie. 

This repository contains all the work I and my team have done for the challenge. It is an analysis on Formula 1 datasets provided by Code First Girls (originally from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). The [formula1dataset.sql](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-sql-challenge/blob/main/formula1dataset.sql) contains my SQL code for producing the Formula 1 datasets and [formula1analysis.sql](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-sql-challenge/blob/main/formula1analysis.sql) contains my SQL code for analysis. [Data & SQL Challenge slides - Lime.pdf](https://github.com/Chicake/cfg-sql-challenge/blob/main/Data%20%26%20SQL%20Challenge%20slides%20-%20Lime.pdf) is the slides used to explain the challenge and presenting. I used the slide template from [slidecarnival](https://www.slidescarnival.com/volumnia-free-presentation-template/10290), which the hyperlink will take you to the downloading page. Below picture is my DB diagram to show the relation between the tables.

### Our team actually made it to top 3 finalists out of 12 groups who participated and I attended [YouTube live session on Code First Girls official channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyASsVm7ICQ) as speaker to talk/present our project using the slides.
